the cube will automatically be mixed with 7 random moves and the resolution time will start.
If you want to mix it with a different number of moves, before pressing "new game" enter the desired
number of moves in the text box on the right


SELF-RESOLUTION

1) The game features an algorithm that solves the cube automatically. Since the complexity is very high,
do not mix the cube with more than 7 moves before solving it. To start the auto-resolution press "Resolve",
he will try a maximum number of moves equal to the text box below.

EXTRA
