# Rubik's Cube Simulator
This is a repository containing my version of a Rubik's Cube simulator, developed towards the end of my career as a high school student, and then brought to the final exam as a thesis. To be fair, nothing has been changed since I took the exam in 2016, only a file was added to explain how the game works.

## Have fun!
